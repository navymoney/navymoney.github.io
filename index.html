<h1 style="color:#800000;">  History of Henna </h1>
<p> Henna is known as the oldest form of body art and originated in India around 3000 BCE. The word henna is derived from the Sanskrit word Mendhika and was then shortened to mehndhi/henna. Henna has been used for centuries in North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. 
<h1 style="color:#800000;"> Significance </h1>
<p> Henna has been historically used for medical purposes as henna has cooling effects and relieves stress. Additionally, henna is used a symbol for happiness and celebration which is why it is most often worn for special occasions like weddings, Eid, Diwali, and other ceremonies. </p>
<h1 style="color:#800000;"> How Do You Make Henna? </h1>
<p> Traditional henna is made from the leaves of the henna tree (also known as mignonette tree or Egyptian privet). You must first dry the henna leaves, powder it, sift it, and mix it with watter before it is ready to use. Modern henna cones often contain combiners like xantham gum and other essential oils. </p>
